## PayTM Challenge

Implementation done from the create react app.

I did not manage to finish the challenge.

If I would have more time I would have:

* Implemented the Middleware that requests the value of the amount in CAD.
* Implemented the request that fetches all the currencies available on useEffect
* Implemented a form validation that takes in consideration the maximum value.

Sadly I could not implement all this with the time given.

Despite I understand I did not accomplish to implement what it was required for this challenge, I hope you still want to have a chat so I can explain how I would have implemented all that it is required for this Challenge.
